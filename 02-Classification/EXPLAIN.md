The equation in the image appears to be related to the expected loss or risk in a classification problem. Let's break it down step by step:

### Equation Breakdown

$$
\ell = \mathbb{E}[L(\Omega, d(\mathbf{X}))]
$$

This denotes the expected loss, where:
- $\ell$ is the expected loss.
- $L(\Omega, d(\mathbf{X}))$ is the loss function given the true state $\Omega$ and the decision rule $d(\mathbf{X})$.

### First Line of the Equation

$$
\ell = \sum_{j=1}^K \int_{\mathcal{R}_j} \sum_{c=1}^K p_{\Omega, \mathbf{X}}(\omega_c, \mathbf{x}) L_{cj} d\mathbf{x}
$$

This expression is broken down as follows:
- The summation $\sum_{j=1}^K$ goes over all regions $\mathcal{R}_j$, where $j$ is the index of the region.
- The integral $\int_{\mathcal{R}_j}$ is taken over each region $\mathcal{R}_j$.
- The inner summation $\sum_{c=1}^K$ goes over all classes $\omega_c$, where $c$ is the index of the class.
- $p_{\Omega, \mathbf{X}}(\omega_c, \mathbf{x})$ is the joint probability density function of the class $\omega_c$ and the feature vector $\mathbf{x}$.
- $L_{cj}$ is the loss associated with classifying $\mathbf{x}$ into class $j$ when the true class is $\omega_c$.

### Second Line of the Equation

$$
\ell = \sum_{j=1}^K \int_{\mathcal{R}} \left( \sum_{c=1}^K L_{cj} \Pr_{\Omega|\mathbf{X}}(\omega_c|\mathbf{x}) \right) p_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) d\mathbf{x}
$$

This line rephrases the first line using conditional probabilities:
- $\mathcal{R}$ is the entire feature space.
- $\Pr_{\Omega|\mathbf{X}}(\omega_c|\mathbf{x})$ is the conditional probability of $\omega_c$ given $\mathbf{x}$.
- $p_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x})$ is the marginal probability density function of the feature vector $\mathbf{x}$.

### Interpretation

The equation represents the expected loss in terms of the joint and conditional probabilities:
1. **First Line**:
   - For each region $\mathcal{R}_j$, it integrates the loss weighted by the joint probability of the class and the feature vector.
2. **Second Line**:
   - It rewrites the first line by expressing the joint probability $p_{\Omega, \mathbf{X}}(\omega_c, \mathbf{x})$ as the product of the conditional probability $\Pr_{\Omega|\mathbf{X}}(\omega_c|\mathbf{x})$ and the marginal probability $p_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x})$.
   - The inner sum computes the expected loss for a given $\mathbf{x}$ across all possible classes $\omega_c$, weighted by their conditional probabilities.

### Summary

The equation calculates the expected loss (risk) by integrating over the entire feature space. It accounts for the probabilities of each class given the features and the associated losses for misclassifications. The second line provides a more interpretable form by using conditional probabilities, which is often easier to compute in practice.
